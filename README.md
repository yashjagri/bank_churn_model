# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN

This model was built to predict churn of the customers of a european bank. The model was created using Tensorflow's keras Sequential class, a Python API for artifical neural networks which enables users to build neural networks by stacking layers linerally. This model was able to predict customer churn with 82% accuracy with precision scores of 0.82 for 0 (No Churn) and 0.67 for 1 (Churn).
